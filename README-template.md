## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I read up on the picture element, whcih I never used before. It's a very convenient way of serving the appropriate image depending on the device.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about best practices for responsiveness especially.

### Useful resources

- [The HTML <picture> Element](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images_picture.asp) - This helped me learn about the picture html element. It's very easy to understand but extremely powerful in my opinion.
